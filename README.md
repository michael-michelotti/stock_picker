# Stock Picker
>- Maintained by: michael-michelotti

## Description
A Python script that allows the user to input a list of stock symbols (tickers) in either CSV (comma separated value) or string (manually typed in, separated by commas) format. The script will query the Yahoo! Finance API pull information on price, dividend, revenue, assets, and earnings per share (EPS). It will chart that data.
